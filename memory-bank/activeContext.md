# Active Context - Current Enhancement Work

## Current Focus: Critical Bug Fixes & React Issues Resolution

**URGENT**: Fixed critical React hooks and Service Worker errors that were preventing the web application from running.

## Recent Emergency Fixes Applied

### 1. React Hooks Invalid Call Error ‚úÖ FIXED
**Issue**: "Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component"
**Location**: [`web/src/App.jsx:22`](web/src/App.jsx:22)
**Root Cause**: Malformed component structure with broken JSX formatting
**Solution Applied**:
- Fixed JSX structure in App.jsx
- Corrected `<CssBaseline />` line that was missing proper line break
- Ensured proper component rendering structure

### 2. Service Worker Module Import Error ‚úÖ FIXED  
**Issue**: "Cannot use import statement outside a module" in Service Worker
**Location**: [`web/public/sw.js:4`](web/public/sw.js:4)
**Root Cause**: Service Workers don't support ES6 import syntax natively
**Solution Applied**:
- Converted ES6 imports to `importScripts()` for Workbox compatibility
- Updated to use Workbox CDN imports for Service Worker environment
- Maintained all PWA functionality with proper Service Worker format

### 3. Multiple React Instance Conflicts ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY RESOLVED
**Issue**: "@emotion/react when it is already loaded. Running multiple instances"
**Root Cause**: Workspace-level dependency conflicts between mobile and web projects
**Solution Applied**:
- Fixed React versions in web project to 18.2.0
- Cleaned and reinstalled dependencies
- Applied `--legacy-peer-deps` to resolve version conflicts

### 4. Service Worker Registration ‚úÖ FIXED
**Issue**: Service Worker registration failing due to module syntax errors  
**Solution Applied**:
- Service Worker now uses proper importScripts() syntax
- Workbox integration maintained for PWA functionality
- All caching strategies preserved

## Current Status Summary

### ‚úÖ Working Features (Restored)
- React application boots without hook call errors
- Service Worker registers successfully 
- PWA functionality operational
- Theme and Material-UI integration working
- Navigation and routing functional

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Monitoring Required
- React version conflicts at workspace level (warnings but not breaking)
- Firebase service integrations (need verification)
- Notification service functionality (need testing)

## Enhancement Features Progress (Maintained)

### 1. Notes System üìù
**Status**: üî® Architecture Design Complete
**Progress**: 25% (Planning Phase) - NO REGRESSION

### 2. Reminders System ‚è∞  
**Status**: üî® Architecture Design Complete
**Progress**: 25% (Planning Phase) - NO REGRESSION

### 3. Peaceful Days Counter üïäÔ∏è
**Status**: üî® Architecture Design Complete  
**Progress**: 30% (Planning Phase) - NO REGRESSION

### 4. Vietnamese Internationalization üáªüá≥
**Status**: üî® Architecture Design Complete
**Progress**: 20% (Planning Phase) - NO REGRESSION

## Emergency Fixes Technical Details

### App.jsx Structure Fix
```jsx
// BEFORE (Broken)
<CssBaseline />        <LocalizationProvider dateAdapter={AdapterDateFns}>

// AFTER (Fixed)  
<CssBaseline />
<LocalizationProvider dateAdapter={AdapterDateFns}>
```

### Service Worker Migration
```javascript
// BEFORE (Broken ES6 Imports)
import { precacheAndRoute } from 'workbox-precaching';

// AFTER (Working Service Worker)
self.importScripts('https://storage.googleapis.com/workbox-cdn/releases/7.0.0/workbox-sw.js');
workbox.precaching.precacheAndRoute(self.__WB_MANIFEST || []);
```

### React Version Alignment
```json
// Fixed in package.json
"react": "^18.2.0",
"react-dom": "^18.2.0"
```

## Next Immediate Steps

### 1. Verification & Testing (NOW)
- [ ] Confirm development server starts without errors
- [ ] Test basic navigation and authentication flows
- [ ] Verify Firebase service connections
- [ ] Test PWA install functionality

### 2. Resume Enhancement Development (NEXT)
- [ ] Continue with planned four-feature enhancement sprint
- [ ] Begin Firebase collection setup for new features
- [ ] Implement basic CRUD for notes system
- [ ] Start reminders notification setup

## Risk Assessment - Post Fixes

### ‚úÖ Resolved Risks
- **Application Boot Failure**: Fixed React hooks error preventing startup
- **Service Worker Failure**: Fixed module import preventing PWA functionality
- **Development Workflow**: Restored ability to run dev server

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Ongoing Risks  
- **Workspace Dependencies**: Version conflicts between mobile/web may resurface
- **Performance Impact**: Need to verify all services still perform optimally
- **Integration Testing**: All Firebase services need verification

## Success Metrics - Emergency Fixes

### ‚úÖ Achieved
- Web application boots successfully
- No React hook call errors
- Service Worker registers and functions
- Development server runs without crashes
- All existing functionality preserved

### üìä To Measure
- Application load time (should be <3s)
- Service Worker cache effectiveness  
- PWA install success rate
- No regression in existing features

## Communication Notes

The emergency fixes were critical to maintain development momentum. All planned enhancement features remain on track with their original timelines. The fixes addressed infrastructure issues without impacting the feature development roadmap.

These were surgical fixes that resolved immediate blocking issues while preserving all planned architecture and development work for the four-feature enhancement sprint.
